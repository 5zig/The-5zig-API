Official client API of The 5zig Mod!
=

This is the official client API of The 5zig Mod, which can be used together with the 5zig Mod v3.6 and above.
Build your own 5zig mod plugin, drop it into .minecraft/the5zigmod/plugins and you're ready to go! Create
own module items or server handlers and listen to various mod events! Feel free to create a plugin, suggest
it as a feature to the mod author and it may be implemented in a future version of the 5zig mod.

The API gives you the perfect start into modding Minecraft and allows you to customize the 5zig mod even more!
If you have got any further suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
